Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~

Comparison operators compare element-wise and *ignore variances*.

   allsorted
   equal
   greater
   greater_equal
   identical

   less
   less_equal
   not_equal

``inf`` and ``nan`` handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special-value (``inf`` and ``nan``) checks.
``inf`` and ``nan`` in the *variances is ignored*.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/functions

   isnan
   isinf
   isfinite
   isposinf
   isneginf
   nan_to_num

Reduction
~~~~~~~~~

Reduction operations are operations to remove one or more dimension, e.g., by performing a sum over all elements along a dimension.

   cumsum
   max
   mean
   median

Counts
~~~~~~

"Counts" refers to the default unit of data after histogramming.
It is also known as frequency.
This can be converted into a counts (frequency) density, e.g., for visualization purposes.
