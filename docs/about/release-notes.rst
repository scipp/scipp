* Add ``redraw`` method to plot which enables an easy update on a figure when the underlying data has been modified `#1907 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/1907>`_.
* Several improvements for work with (3-D position) vectors and (3-D rotation) matrices `#1905 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/1905>`_:

  * Add creation functions ``vector``, ``vectors``, ``matrix``, ``matrices``.
  * Direct creation and initialization of 2-D (or higher) arrays of matrices and vectors is now possible from numpy arrays.
  * Fix extremely slow initialization of array of vectors or matrices from numpy arrays.

v0.5.0 (January 2021)
---------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* New ``profile`` plotting functionality where one of the slider dimensions can be displayed as a profile in a subplot (1-D and 2-D projections only).
* Sliders have a thickness slider associated with them and can be used to show slices of arbitrary thickness.
* Can hide/show individual masks on plots.
* Can toggle log scale of axes and colorbar with buttons in figure toolbar.
* Add binned data support, replacing "event list" dtypes as well as "realign" support.
* Plotting of event data (binned data) with dynamic resampling with "infinite zoom" functionality.
* Value-based slicing support.
* Possibility to plot Scipp objects using ``my_data_array.plot()`` in addition to the classical ``plot()`` free function.
* Support for saving and loading scipp data structures to HDF5.
* More functions such as ``nanmean`` for better handling of special values such as ``INF`` and ``NaN``.
* TBB (multi-threading) support for MacOS.
* ``scipp.neutron``

  * Improved instrument view, e.g., with buttons to align camera with an axis.
  * Experiment logs (previously using Mantid's ``Run``) are now represented as native scipp objects, e.g., as scalar attributes holding a data array representing a time-series such as a temperature log.
  * Support conversion of ``mantid.MaskWorkspace``.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Dataset`` does not have a ``masks`` property any more.
  Use ``ds['item'].masks`` instead.
* ``Dataset`` does not support attributes any more.
* ``DataArray`` and dataset item attributes are now are now handled as "unaligned" coords.
  Use ``ds['item'].coords`` or ``array.attrs`` to access these.
* API for log scale on axes and colors has changed.
  Use ``plot(da, scale={'tof': 'log'})`` to set a log scale on a coordinate axis, and use ``plot(da, norm='log')`` to have a log image colorscale or a log y axis on a 1d plot.
* ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` now represent absolute values instead of exponents when ``norm='log'``.
* The ``ipympl`` matplotlib backend is now required for using inside Jupyter notebooks.
  This has been added as a dependency.
  It is also the only interactive backend that works in JupyterLab.
* Removed support for ``event_list`` ``dtype``, use binned data instead.
* Removed support for "realigned" data. This is replaced by the more flexible and generic support for "binned" data.

v0.4 (July 2020)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* New realign functionality.
* Support for event-filtering.
* Support for subtraction and addition for (realigned) event data.
* Non-range slicing changed to preserve coords as attrs rather than dropping
* ``scipp.neutron``: Instrument view with advanced geometry support, showing correct pixel shapes.
* Instrument view working on doc pages.
* Made it simpler to add new ``dtype`` and support ``transform`` for all types.
* Comparison functions such as ``less``, ``greater_equal``, ...
* ``all`` and ``any`` can work over all dimensions as well as explicitly provided dimension argument
* It is now possible to convert between Scipp objects and Python dictionaries using ``to_dict`` and ``from_dict``.
* New functions ``collapse`` and ``slices`` can be use to split one or more dimensions of a DataArray to a dict of DataArrays.
* You can now inspect the global object list of via the ``repr`` for scipp showing Datasets, DataArrays and Variables
* Internal cleanup and documentation additions.

Noteable bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Several fixes in the plotting (non-regular bins, colorbar limits, axes tick labels from unaligned coordinates, etc...)

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Coord and attributes names for neutron data have been standardized, now using hyphens instead of underscore, except for subscripts. Affected examples: ``pulse-time`` (previously ``pulse_times``), ``source-position`` (previously ``source_position``), ``sample-position`` (previously ``sample_position``), ``detector-info`` (previously ``detector_info``).
* ``scipp.neutron.load`` must use ``advanced_geometry=True`` option for loading ``detector-info`` and pixel shapes.
* Normalization of event data cannot be done directly any more, must use ``realign``.
* Plotting variances in 2D has been removed, and the API for using ``matplotlib`` axes has been simplified slightly, since we no longer have axes for variances:

  * Before: ``plot(..., mpl_axes={"ax": myax0, "cax": myax1})``
  * After: ``plot(..., ax=myax0, cax=myax1)``
* Plot with keyword argument ``collapse`` has been removed in favor of two more generic free functions that return a ``dict`` of data arrays that can then directly be passed to the ``plot`` function:

  * ``collapse(d, keep='x')`` slices all dimensions away to keep only ``'x'``, thus always returning 1D slices.
  * ``slices(d, dim='x')`` slices along dimension ``'x'``, returning slices with ``ndim-1`` dimensions contaiing all dimensions other than ``'x'``.

v0.3 (March 2020)
-----------------

* Many bug fixes and small additions
* Multi-threading with TBB for many operations.
* Performance improvements in hotspots
* Remove ``Dim`` labels in favor of plain strings. Connected to this, the ``labels`` property for data arrays and datasets has been removed. Use ``coords`` instead.

v0.2 (December 2019)
--------------------

* Support for masks stored in ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset``.

* Support for ``groupby``, implementing a split-apply-combine approach as known from pandas.

* Enhanced support for event data:

  * Histogramming with "weighted" data.
  * Multiplication/division operators between event data and histogram.

* Enhanced plotting support:

  * Now focussing on ``matplotlib``.
  * Multi-dimensional plots with interactive sliders, and much more.

* Significant performance improvements for majority of operations. Typically performance is now in the same ballpark as what the memory bandwidth on a single CPU core can support.

* Fancy ``_repr_html_`` for quick views of datasets in Jupyter notebooks.

* Conda packages now also available for Windows.

* ``scipp.neutron`` gets improved converters from Mantid, supporting neutron monitors, sample information, and run information stored as attributes.

v0.1 (September 2019)
---------------------

This is the first official release of ``scipp``.
It is not yet meant for production-use, but marks a big step for us in terms of usability and features.
The API may change without notice in future releases.

Features:

* All key data structures (``Variable``, ``DataArray``, and ``Dataset``).
* Slicing.
* Basic arithmetic operations.
* Physical units.
* Propagation of uncertainties.
* Event data.

Limitations:

* Limited performance and no parallelization.
* Numerous "edge cases" not supported yet.
* While tested, probably far from bug-free.
