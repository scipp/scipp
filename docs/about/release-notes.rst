=============

v0.14.0 (unreleased)
--------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added argument `max_rows` to :func:`scipp.table` `#2526 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2526>`_.
* Added support for converting scalars to builtin objects via :func:`int` and :func:`float` `#2529 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2529>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix :func:`scipp.isclose` and :func:`scipp.allclose` to support arguments without a unit `#2528 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2528>`_.

v0.12.0 (February 2022)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added support for :py:func:`abs` to :py:class:`scipp.DataArray`, :py:class:`scipp.Dataset`, :py:class:`scipp.Variable` `#2382 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2382>`_.
* :py:func:`scipp.bin` will now also look at attributes to perform the binning, instead of only looking at the coordinates `#2388 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2388>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.squeeze` to remove length-1 dimensions `#2385 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2385>`_.
* Switched to new system for runtime configuration, see the corresponding section in the reference documentation `#2389 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2389>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.midpoints` which can be used to compute bin-centers `#2404 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2404>`_.
* :py:func:`scipp.fold` now supports ``-1`` for one of the dimension sizes, to indicate automatic shape `#2414 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2414>`_.
* Added ``quiet`` argument to :py:func:`scipp.transform_coords` `#2420 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2420>`_.
* Added support for strides for positional slicing. Negative strides are not supported for now `#2423 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2423>`_.
* :py:func:`scipp.zeros_like`, :py:func:`scipp.ones_like`, :py:func:`scipp.empty_like`, and :py:func:`scipp.full_like` now accept and return data arrays `#2425 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2425>`_.
* Added the ``.rename`` method to :py:class:`scipp.Variable`, :py:class:`scipp.DataArray`, and :py:class:`scipp.Dataset` that renames both dimensions and coords/attrs at the same time `#2428 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2428>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The configuration option ``config['plot']['padding']`` is now called ``config['plot']['bounding_box']``, no action is required if it was never modified `#2389 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2389>`_.
* :py:func:`scipp.rebin` now applies masks that depend on the rebinning dimension to avoid "growing" effect on masks which previously resulted in masking more than intended `#2383 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2383>`_.
* The ``unit`` attribute now distinguishes ``None`` from ``dimensionless`` `#2395 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2395>`_ and `#2417 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2417>`_.

  * For number-like dtypes the default is ``dimensionless`` (unchanged) whereas all other dtypes such as strings default to ``None`` (new).
  * ``bool`` (used for masks) is not considered number-like and the default unit is ``None``.
  * Comparison operator results now use ``None`` as unit of their output.
  * When integers without unit are used as indices, the new :py:func:`scipp.index` can be used to create a scalar variable without unit.

* :py:func:`scipp.spatial.rotations_from_rotvecs` has been changed to taking a variable input rather than separate values/dims/units.
* ``scipp.NotFoundError`` error has been replaced with ``KeyError`` in Python `#2416 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2416>`_.
* Some functions now raise ``scipp.DimensionError`` instead of ``scipp.NotFoundError`` `#2416 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2416>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix :py:func:`scipp.full`, which previously converted or attempted to convert all values to ``float64`` unless the ``dtype`` was specified explicitly `#2395 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2395>`_.
* Fix :py:func:`scipp.transform_coords` for sliced binned data, used to raise an exception `#2406 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2406>`_.
* Fix 1d plots y-axis limits when toggling log-scale with buttons and fix 2d plot colorbar when Inf values `#2426 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2426>`_.
* Fix bug leading to datasets dims/shape modification after failed item insertion `#2437 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2437>`_.
* Fix a plotting bug when 2d data has y coord associated with dimension x `#2446 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2446>`_.
* Fix plotting with custom tick labels of ``dtype=datetime64`` which previously raised an exception `#2449 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2449>`_.

v0.11.0 (January 2022)
----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added new datatypes for representing spatial transformations: ``affine_transform3``, ``rotation3``, and ``translation3``. Each of these can be combined and applied to the existing vector datatype.
* Added support for slicing without specifying a dimension (only for 1-D objects) `#2321 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2321>`_.

* Added :py:func:`scipp.integrate.trapezoid` and :py:func:`scipp.integrate.simpson` as convenience wrappers of the scipy functions of the same name `#2324 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2324>`_.
* Added ``unit`` property to ``obj.bins`` for getting and setting unit of bin elements `#2330 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2330>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.optimize.curve_fit` as convenience wrappers of the scipy function of the same name `#2350 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2350>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.signal.butter` and :py:func:`scipp.signal.sosfiltfilt` as wrappers of the scipy functions of the same name `#2356 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2356>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.Variable.to` and :py:func:`scipp.DataArray.to` as a convenience function for simultaneously converting dtype and units.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.datetime`, :py:func:`scipp.datetimes`, and :py:func:`scipp.epoch` to conveniently construct variables containing datetimes `#2360 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2360>`_.
* Added ``camera`` option for 3-D scatter plots to control camera position and the point the camera is looking at `#2361 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2361>`_.
* Allow more interoperability between :py:class:`scipp.DType` and other ways of encoding dtypes `#2373 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2373>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Minor change in behavior of dimension renaming in ``transform_coords``, new behavior documented in `Coordinate transformations <../user-guide/coordinate-transformations.rst>`_. Most use cases are unaffected. `#2319 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2319>`_.
* ``sc.spatial.transform.as_rotvec`` has been moved to :py:func:`scipp.spatial.rotation_as_rotvec`
* ``sc.spatial.transform.from_rotvec`` has been moved to :py:func:`scipp.spatial.rotations_from_rotvecs`, and now returns a rotation data type rather than a matrix.
  For consistency with other transformation creation functions, ``rotations_from_rotvecs`` now takes ``values``, ``dims``, and ``unit`` separately.
* The matrix dtype ``matrix_3_float64`` has been renamed to ``linear_transform3``, and should now be constructed with :py:func:`scipp.spatial.linear_transform`.
* The vector dtype ``vector_3_float64`` has been renamed to ``vector3``.
* Scipp's logger is no longer preconfigured, this has to be done by the user `#2372 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2372>`_.
* Data types are now attributes of the :py:class:`scipp.DType` class and the ``scipp.dtype`` module has been removed `#2373 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2373>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix coordinate and attribute comparisons to treat NaN (not-a-number) values as equal, which previously prevented most operations with data arrays or datasets that contained NaN values in their coordinates or attributes `#2331 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2331>`_.
* Fix incorrect result from ``sc.bin`` when rebinning an inner dimension to a multi-dimensional coordinate `#2355 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2355>`_.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``sc.matrix`` and ``sc.matrices`` have been deprecated in favour of :py:func:`scipp.spatial.linear_transform` and :py:func:`scipp.spatial.linear_transforms`, and will be removed in a future release of scipp.
* The previously deprecated ``concatenate`` and ``groupby(..).concatenate`` have been removed. Use :py:func:`scipp.concat` and :py:func:`scipp.GroupByDataArray.concat` instead.

v0.5.0 (January 2021)
---------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* New ``profile`` plotting functionality where one of the slider dimensions can be displayed as a profile in a subplot (1-D and 2-D projections only).
* Sliders have a thickness slider associated with them and can be used to show slices of arbitrary thickness.
* Can hide/show individual masks on plots.
* Can toggle log scale of axes and colorbar with buttons in figure toolbar.
* Add binned data support, replacing "event list" dtypes as well as "realign" support.
* Plotting of event data (binned data) with dynamic resampling with "infinite zoom" functionality.
* Value-based slicing support.
* Possibility to plot Scipp objects using ``my_data_array.plot()`` in addition to the classical ``plot()`` free function.
* Support for saving and loading scipp data structures to HDF5.
* More functions such as ``nanmean`` for better handling of special values such as ``INF`` and ``NaN``.
* TBB (multi-threading) support for MacOS.
* ``scipp.neutron``

  * Improved instrument view, e.g., with buttons to align camera with an axis.
  * Experiment logs (previously using Mantid's ``Run``) are now represented as native scipp objects, e.g., as scalar attributes holding a data array representing a time-series such as a temperature log.
  * Support conversion of ``mantid.MaskWorkspace``.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Dataset`` does not have a ``masks`` property any more.
  Use ``ds['item'].masks`` instead.
* ``Dataset`` does not support attributes any more.
* ``DataArray`` and dataset item attributes are now are now handled as "unaligned" coords.
  Use ``ds['item'].coords`` or ``array.attrs`` to access these.
* API for log scale on axes and colors has changed.
  Use ``plot(da, scale={'tof': 'log'})`` to set a log scale on a coordinate axis, and use ``plot(da, norm='log')`` to have a log image colorscale or a log y axis on a 1d plot.
* ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` now represent absolute values instead of exponents when ``norm='log'``.
* The ``ipympl`` matplotlib backend is now required for using inside Jupyter notebooks.
  This has been added as a dependency.
  It is also the only interactive backend that works in JupyterLab.
* Removed support for ``event_list`` ``dtype``, use binned data instead.
* Removed support for "realigned" data. This is replaced by the more flexible and generic support for "binned" data.

v0.4 (July 2020)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* New realign functionality.
* Support for event-filtering.
* Support for subtraction and addition for (realigned) event data.
* Non-range slicing changed to preserve coords as attrs rather than dropping
* ``scipp.neutron``: Instrument view with advanced geometry support, showing correct pixel shapes.
* Instrument view working on doc pages.
* Made it simpler to add new ``dtype`` and support ``transform`` for all types.
* Comparison functions such as ``less``, ``greater_equal``, ...
* ``all`` and ``any`` can work over all dimensions as well as explicitly provided dimension argument
* It is now possible to convert between Scipp objects and Python dictionaries using ``to_dict`` and ``from_dict``.
* New functions ``collapse`` and ``slices`` can be use to split one or more dimensions of a DataArray to a dict of DataArrays.
* You can now inspect the global object list of via the ``repr`` for scipp showing Datasets, DataArrays and Variables
* Internal cleanup and documentation additions.

Noteable bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Several fixes in the plotting (non-regular bins, colorbar limits, axes tick labels from unaligned coordinates, etc...)

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Coord and attributes names for neutron data have been standardized, now using hyphens instead of underscore, except for subscripts. Affected examples: ``pulse-time`` (previously ``pulse_times``), ``source-position`` (previously ``source_position``), ``sample-position`` (previously ``sample_position``), ``detector-info`` (previously ``detector_info``).
* ``scipp.neutron.load`` must use ``advanced_geometry=True`` option for loading ``detector-info`` and pixel shapes.
* Normalization of event data cannot be done directly any more, must use ``realign``.
* Plotting variances in 2D has been removed, and the API for using ``matplotlib`` axes has been simplified slightly, since we no longer have axes for variances:

  * Before: ``plot(..., mpl_axes={"ax": myax0, "cax": myax1})``
  * After: ``plot(..., ax=myax0, cax=myax1)``
* Plot with keyword argument ``collapse`` has been removed in favor of two more generic free functions that return a ``dict`` of data arrays that can then directly be passed to the ``plot`` function:

  * ``collapse(d, keep='x')`` slices all dimensions away to keep only ``'x'``, thus always returning 1D slices.
  * ``slices(d, dim='x')`` slices along dimension ``'x'``, returning slices with ``ndim-1`` dimensions contaiing all dimensions other than ``'x'``.

* Enhanced support for event data:

  * Histogramming with "weighted" data.
  * Multiplication/division operators between event data and histogram.

* Enhanced plotting support:

  * Now focussing on ``matplotlib``.
  * Multi-dimensional plots with interactive sliders, and much more.

* Significant performance improvements for majority of operations. Typically performance is now in the same ballpark as what the memory bandwidth on a single CPU core can support.

* Fancy ``_repr_html_`` for quick views of datasets in Jupyter notebooks.

* Conda packages now also available for Windows.

* ``scipp.neutron`` gets improved converters from Mantid, supporting neutron monitors, sample information, and run information stored as attributes.

v0.1 (September 2019)
---------------------

This is the first official release of ``scipp``.
It is not yet meant for production-use, but marks a big step for us in terms of usability and features.
The API may change without notice in future releases.

Features:

* All key data structures (``Variable``, ``DataArray``, and ``Dataset``).
* Slicing.
* Basic arithmetic operations.
* Physical units.
* Propagation of uncertainties.
* Event data.

Limitations:

* Limited performance and no parallelization.
* Numerous "edge cases" not supported yet.
* While tested, probably far from bug-free.
