Scipp is a open source project by the `European Spallation Source ERIC <https://europeanspallationsource.se/>`_ (ESS).

References and citations
------------------------

An article about Scipp has been published in the conference proceedings of ICANS, see `Scipp: Scientific data handling with labeled multi-dimensional arrays for C++ and Python <https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-neutron-research/jnr190131>`_ or `the paywall-free copy on the Arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00257>`_.

A significant amount of changes such as multi-threading and support for binned (event) data has gone into scipp since the publication so we recommend to also cite the Scipp documentation pages.
