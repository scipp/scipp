Getting Started
===============

TL;DR
-----

Standard setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  # Get the code
  git clone git@github.com:scipp/scipp.git && cd scipp
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

  # Setup dev env
  mamba env create -f docs/environments/developer.yml
  conda activate scipp-dev
  pre-commit install
  pre-commit run --all-files

  # Build, install, and run C++ tests
  cmake --preset base
  cmake --build --preset build
  ctest --preset test

  # Setup editable install and run Python tests
  tox -e editable
  conda develop src
  python -m pytest

You should now also be able to run ``python -c 'import scipp as sc'``.

Common tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the below assume that the standard setup outlined above was performed.

Build the docs:

.. code-block:: bash

   tox -e docs

   # To clean and build all docs

   tox -e docs-clean

Update the pip requirements via ``pip-compile-multi``:

.. code-block:: bash

   tox -e deps

Prepare a release (make sure to give the desired release instead):

.. code-block:: bash

   tox -e prepare-release -- 23.01.0

Overview
--------

We provide a Conda environment file with developer dependencies in our Git repository.
Other build dependencies are installed automatically through Conan when running CMake.
See `Tooling <tooling.rst>`_ for compilers and other required tools.

Getting the code
----------------

Clone the git repository (either via SSH or HTTPS) from `GitHub <https://github.com/scipp/scipp>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:scipp/scipp.git
  cd scipp

  # Update Git submodules
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

  # Create Conda environment with dependencies and development tools
  mamba env create -f docs/environments/developer.yml
  conda activate scipp-dev

Pre-commit Hooks
----------------

We use ``pre-commit`` for static analysis and code formatting.
Install the pre-commit hooks to avoid committing non-compliant code.
In the source directory run:

.. code-block:: bash

  pre-commit install
  pre-commit run --all-files

Building Scipp
--------------

As big parts of Scipp are written in C++, we use CMake for building.
This assumes you will end up with a directory structure similar to the following.
If you want something different be sure to modify paths as appropriate:

.. code-block::

  |-- /home/user/scipp (source code)
  |   |-- build (build directory)
  |   |-- install (Python library installation)
  |   |-- ...
  |-- ...

To build and install the library:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Create build and library install directories
  mkdir build
  mkdir install
  cd build

If you are running on Windows, you need to use a visual studio developer command prompt for the following steps. This can be opened manually from the start menu, or programmatically by calling the appropriate vcvars script, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"

If you wish to build using the Visual Studio CMake generators instead, there is a ``windows-msbuild`` CMake preset for this purpose.

To build a debug version of the library:

.. code-block:: bash

  cmake \
    -GNinja \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DPython_EXECUTABLE=$(command -v python3) \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install \
    -DCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION=OFF \
    -DDYNAMIC_LIB=ON \
    ..

  # C++ unit tests
  cmake --build . --target all-tests

  # Benchmarks
  cmake --build . --target all-benchmarks

  # Install Python library
  cmake --build . --target install

Alternatively, to build a release version with all optimizations enabled:

.. code-block:: bash

  cmake \
    -GNinja \
    -DPython_EXECUTABLE=$(command -v python3) \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    ..

  cmake --build . --target all-tests
  cmake --build . --target all-benchmarks
  cmake --build . --target install


To use the ``scipp`` Python module:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda develop /home/user/scipp/install

In Python:

.. code-block:: python

  import scipp as sc

Some developers may prefer an "editable" install, i.e., with changes to Python files in the ``src`` directly becoming visible without reinstalling.
This is commonly done via ``pip install -e .``.
However, Scipp uses ``scikit-build``, which currently does not fully support this directly.
Therefore, we need to call ``cmake`` manually in this case and install into the Python source directory, or create symlinks.
We have configured ``tox`` for this purpose:

.. code-block:: bash

  cmake --preset base -DCONAN_TBB=ON
  cmake --build --preset build
  tox -e editable
  conda develop src

Here ``conda develop src`` can also be replaced by ``pip install -e .``.
Above we used some of the ``cmake`` presets, but you may also call ``cmake`` without those for more control of the options.
We can also use tox instead of the first two lines:

.. code-block:: bash

  tox -e lib
  tox -e editable
  conda develop src

You can now use the editable install as usual, i.e., changes to Python files of Scipp are directly visible when importing Scipp, without the need for a new install.
When making changes to the C++ side of Scipp, you will need to re-run the ``install`` target using ``cmake``, e.g.,

.. code-block:: bash

  cmake --build --preset build


Additional build options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``-DDYNAMIC_LIB`` forces the shared libraries building, that also decreases link time.
2. ``-DTHREADING`` enable or disable multi-threading. ``ON`` by default.
3. ``-DPRECOMPILED_HEADERS`` toggle usage of precompiled headers. ``OFF`` by default.
4. ``-DCPPCHECK`` toggle run of cppcheck during compilation. ``OFF`` by default.
5. ``-DCTEST_DISCOVER_TESTS`` toggle discovery of individual tests for better (but much slower) integration with ``ctest``. ``OFF`` by default.
6. ``-DSKIP_CONAN`` skip usage of conan to fetch and build c++ dependencies. ``OFF`` by default. All the dependencies should be installed on the system already.

Running the unit tests
----------------------

After editing C++ code or tests, make sure to update the build/install:

.. code-block:: bash

  cmake --build --preset build

Alternatively, the ``all-tests`` CMake target can be used to build all tests.

There are two ways of running C++ tests.
Executables for the unit tests can be found in the build directory as ``build/bin/scipp-XYZ-test``, where ``XYZ`` is the Scipp component under test (e.g. ``core``).
These use ``google-test`` and provide full control over options, e.g., to filter tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./build/bin/scipp-common-test
   ./build/bin/scipp-core-test
   ./build/bin/scipp-units-test
   ./build/bin/scipp-variable-test
   ./build/bin/scipp-dataset-test

Alternatively, use ``ctest``:

.. code-block:: bash

  ctest --preset test

If only Python code or tests have been updated, there is no need to rebuild or reinstall, provided that you use an editable install (using ``conda develop src`` as described earlier).

To run the Python tests, run (in the top-level directory):

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pytest tests


Building Documentation
----------------------

Run

.. code-block:: bash

  tox -e lib  # omit if using cmake, or install is up-to-date
  tox -e docs


This will build the HTML documentation and put it in a folder named ``html``.
If you want to build all docs after cleaning ``html`` and ``doctrees`` folders, please use ``tox -e docs-clean``.


Using Scipp as a C++ library
----------------------------

Using Scipp as a C++ library is not recommended at this point as the API (and ABI) is not stable and documentation is sparse.
Nonetheless, it can be used as a ``cmake`` package as follows.
In your ``CMakeLists.txt``:

.. code-block:: cmake

  # replace 23.01 with required version
  find_package(scipp 23.01 REQUIRED COMPONENTS conan-config)
  find_package(scipp 23.01 REQUIRED)

  target_link_libraries(mytarget PUBLIC scipp::dataset)

If Scipp was install using ``conda``, ``cmake`` should find it automatically.
If you build and installed Scipp from source use, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: bash

  cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<your_scipp_install_dir>

where ``<your_scipp_install_dir>`` should point to the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` that was used when building Scipp.
Alternative set the ``Scipp_DIR`` or ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` (environment) variables to this path.


Generating coverage reports
---------------------------

- Run ``cmake`` with options ``-DCOVERAGE=On -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug``.
- Run ``cmake --build . --target coverage`` from your build directory.
- Open ``coverage/index.html`` in a browser.
