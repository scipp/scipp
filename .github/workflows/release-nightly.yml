      # The current implementation in this workflow has a bug, commenting out the delete step
      # so we don't mistakenly delete the current nightly release. This will be fixed once we
      # can start using the delete wheel action from scientific-python/upload-nightly-action
      # upstream. It's okay to keep uploading wheels to pypi.anaconda.org/scipp-nightly-wheels
      # for now, we can clean it up once the new action is released.
